# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Kudos on including user stories in your readme. Next time strongly encourage you to include some additional information like challenges encountered or installation instructions. A detailed readme goes a long way.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. You knocked it out of the park in this department. Impressed to see some of the OOJS we'll be going over later in the course.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Your code was very readable. It could benefit from some refactoring. As you suggested, there are opportunities to make it more DRY that I think will be apparent the next time you look through this. There are areas where spacing/indentation could be more consistent, but not a big deal.

I left a bunch of inline code comments. Check them out by clicking the link below...

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Great job on this assignment. You've got a great grasp on what we went over Weeks 1 and 2 (and then some!). Let me know if you'd like to discuss ways to take this project to the next level (e.g., styling, DRYness). But you should be extremely proud of what you accomplished here.
